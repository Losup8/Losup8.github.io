         time outdoors, playing on my PC, or learning programming. What motivates me the most is simply the fact that I 
         enjoy what I do. In terms of personal development, I focus on seeking out information and continuously learning
          through research.</h1>

I aspire to further my studies in IT at both high school and university levels. To continuously improve my skills, I actively seek out information and resources to
        enhance my programming knowledge.</h1>
    <h1 class="Link5"Skills>Skills <hr>I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, which I apply through my projects. My 
        approach to problem-solving involves researching and resolving coding challenges. I am committed to continuous learning 
        and actively seek new information to improve my programming skills. Looking ahead, I aspire to study IT at a specialized
        high school and university.</h1>
